subTitle: Agility is a lot more about unlearning than learning
abstract: If we were a bunch of seasoned programmers, I am pretty sure we would have taken much more time and a ton of politics. This experience has taught me that to "be Agile" is natural for these students. Somewhere we professionals "unlearned" it and we are struggling to learn it again.

During the 3rd week of August 2020, I stumbled upon an idea to build a website for students in Kerala, The idea was to collate, order, arrange and tag the videos released by Kerala State Governments for easier access to students across the State. I was in uncharted waters and naturally I called for help, students across the globe joined hands, with a team of 20 students we initiated a small program "www.vidhyalayam.online". Within 10 days we brought up the site to include 1000+ videos with the help of 350+ pull requests, 700 + commits. By the way, this is production-grade software primarily built by students who had never written a single piece of code before & they did it along with their day to day studies, exams, etc. If we were a bunch of seasoned programmers, I am pretty sure we would have taken much more time and a ton of politics. This experience has taught me that to "be Agile" is natural for these students. Somewhere we professionals "unlearned" it and we are struggling to learn it again. I rest my case with the wonderful work built by our team of students as a living memento to prove "Agility is a lot more about unlearning than learning ", BTW the youngest of our students is in his 6th grade & we never formally taught any one how to be Agile or what is DevOps. Kudos to this team of Software Developers for being such an inspiration.
